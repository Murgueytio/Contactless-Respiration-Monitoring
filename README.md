# Contactless-Respiration-Monitoring
As part of my Disaster Survivor Detection Systems (DSDS) project, I am developing a UWB signal processing model for the detection of breathing and heartbeat (of humans under debris after a natural disaster) from open source or synthetic data.
I obtained the data from MobiVital: A Dataset for Contactless Respiration Monitoring Using UWB Radar https://zenodo.org/records/15022885 and https://github.com/nesl/MobiVital-dataset of Professor Mani Srivastava from UCLA.
